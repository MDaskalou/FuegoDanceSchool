  "review_1_text": "There are so many reasons why I think everyone should come and learn bachata at Fuego! If I could only choose a few, it's because the teachers are truly committed to teaching the right technique, they are passionate about what they do – and it really shows. The assistant instructors are also incredibly supportive, always ready to help and ensure everyone feels comfortable and encouraged. It's a place where you not only develop as a dancer but also feel part of a fantastic community.",

  "review_2_text": "Fuego is a dance school where you feel welcome from the start. The teachers are knowledgeable and helpful. For me, dance has not always been a given; when I started at Fuego, I was very insecure in dance contexts, afraid of making mistakes, which made me tense and less motivated.\n\nFuego has helped me grow as a dancer; you get feedback on a more personal level, both from the instructors and from the assistant instructors, which is invaluable. The instructors are also responsive and adapt lesson plans according to knowledge but also consider requests. At Fuego, a lot of focus is placed on technique, knowing how to perform a movement correctly before executing it, and drilling the basics. This is something I personally have found very useful in social dances.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend Fuego, whether you are a beginner or an experienced dancer, this is a school for you.",

  "review_5_text": "What I appreciate about Fuego is that you feel seen and receive specific feedback based on your dance level. With fantastic teachers and assistant teachers, there's always someone there with encouraging words and constructive feedback.\nCourses combine theory and practice, which also gives you a better understanding of the dance instead of just learning a choreography.\nThe atmosphere in the courses is very positive, and you quickly feel part of a larger community.\nI have only good things to say about Mikael and his team! I recommend Fuego to anyone who wants to develop as a dancer, regardless of level."
