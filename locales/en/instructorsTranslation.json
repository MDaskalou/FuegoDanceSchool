  "instructor_tomas_description": "Tomas Steifo was born and raised in Sweden. He discovered bachata in a rather unexpected way, after injuring his elbow during a martial arts competition. During his rehabilitation, he one day happened to see people dancing bachata outdoors. It immediately caught his interest, and he thought: 'Why not try?' Since September 2021, he hasn't stopped dancing.\n\nOver the years, Tomas has participated in many competitions, traveled, taught at festivals, and even judged dance competitions. Much of his inspiration comes from his background in MMA, especially the way techniques are broken down and taught there.\n\nThat mindset has strongly influenced how he teaches dance today. For Tomas, the best part is seeing his students develop and surprise themselves – that moment when something suddenly clicks for them is what means most to him.",
